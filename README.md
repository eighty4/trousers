# Trousers platform for Plaid APIs

A hobby project to bootstrap fintech startups that specialize in modular JavaScript monorepos.

## Building Trousers

Trousers' monorepo is managed by [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

```
pnpm -r build
```

### Interactive update with `pnpm`

The update command can be used interactively and recursively to upgrade project dependencies:

```shell
pnpm update --interactive --latest --recursive
```
